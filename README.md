# Quick Linker

Similar to Firefox keywords for favourites, this little extension lets you link a keyword to a web URL to quickly navigate.

Keywords are activated by first typing the extension keyword, "go", then typing your keyword - e.g. "yt" -> "https://youtube.com/feed/subscriptions"

Keywords can be removed from the extension options page, accessed by clicking the settings button in the extension popup.

Below is the Github repository if you would like to see what the extension is doing. Please note that I'm an not a professional developer and my code could use improving.

If you have any feature or code suggestions (or you just want to say thanks) please pm me on Github :)
